# CoinBag Development Plan

This document outlines planned functionality and upcoming milestones for the CoinBag project.

## Near Term Goals

1. **Authentication** – integrate user login with Supabase Auth.
2. **Enhanced Dashboard** – display charts of spending over time and upcoming bills.
3. **Rich Expense Entry** – support categories, tags and recurring expenses.
4. **Improved Bank Sync** – background sync of transactions and balance updates.
5. **Offline Support** – queue actions locally and sync when connectivity returns.

## Longer Term Ideas

- Push notifications for large transactions and low balances

This plan will evolve as development progresses. Completed items will be moved to the changelog and new tasks will be added.
